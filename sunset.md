Dear Secretnodes Community,

We are excited to about the return of the Secretnodes Explorer! In May 2023, we had to temporarily shut down the explorer due to insufficient funding and lack of network support. Contrary to some false claims, we never abandoned our mission. The shutdown was solely a result of financial challenges and a lack of continued formal support.

Formally since November 2024, with the support of the Secret Network Foundation, and earlier in 2024 trying to find a path forward, we are working to successfully relaunched the explorer. This renewed backing allows us to enhance the products reliability and continue our commitment to the Secret Network ecosystem.

Thank you to our original supporters and everyone who helped us bring the Secretnodes Explorer back. We look forward to serving the network once again.

Currently the explorer is up in beta at secretnodes.com, stay tuned for updates and more information.

Warm regards,

The Secretnodes Team
