Dear Secret Community,

This serves as an update to the prior sunset announcement given the upcoming return of Secretnodes Explorer. In May 2023, we had to shut down the explorer due to insufficient funding and lack of continued formal network support. Contrary to some false claims, we never abandoned our mission. The shutdown was solely a result of financial challenges and the absence of continued formal support.

Since November 2024, with the support of the Secret Network Foundation—and after months of privately seeking a path forward—we have successfully relaunched the explorer in beta. This renewed backing allows us to enhance the product's reliability and continue our commitment to the Secret Network ecosystem with the explorer.

Thank you to our original supporters and everyone who helped bring the Secretnodes Explorer back. We are excited to see it serve the network once again.

The explorer is currently available in beta at secretnodes.com. Stay tuned for updates and more information.

Warm regards,

The Secretnodes Team
